# my_first_off_platform_SQLproject
Created a database off platform using PostreSQL and Postbird

  See screenshot of the database I made. 

This is a mini-project I did to become familar working off platform with PostgreSQL client. 

Performed several statements for practice: create, insert, alter, update, delete
